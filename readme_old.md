# Sweet Libs

Today is an all-day structured exercise in developing the skill you're likely to use most in the Industry: teaching yourself something new.

By yourself or with one or more others of your choosing, please pick a useful library or technology we have not covered in class.

## Grouping

It's no secret that learning on your own is something you can do outside of GA. However, more often than not, you will be expected to learn things on your own in a vacuum. This is an exercise in *learning to learn*, rather than in learning a new technology. You'll get the greatest amount of value collaborating with someone else: note what they picked up and how.

Additionally, you'll have to do a fraction of the work: one person can work on the documentation, another can work on the example code, and so on.

That said, we left the groupings open-ended to provide an opportunity for those who really want some dedicated time to research a topic to do so at their leisure. But for the rest of you, grouping will provide a definite long-term advantage.

**The only limitation to grouping is that a team can have a maximum of three people.**

## Build Something

Create an app that demonstrates your subject. It should...
- Be published to a Github repository.
- Be very small, with no more than 50 total lines of code, if possible (**excluding comments**).
- Be well-commented with notes.
- Be a good example of why someone might want to use your code.
- **DO NOT** follow the [DTROTFO](https://i.imgur.com/RadSf.jpg) methodology.

> Once you complete all the above requirements, you may go on to build something larger than 50 lines if you'd like.

## Document It

Your repository must include a `readme.md` that answers the following questions regarding your subject. No need to write a book!

- Why did you choose this subject?
  - How were you first made aware of it?
- What problem does it solve?
  - How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?
- Why does one use it?
  - What are the alternatives?
  - What is it similar to, if anything?
- What is the history of this technology?
  - Who built it and why?
  - Who is maintaining it?
- What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
- What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?
- What resources do you recommend for interested students?
  - What article or forum was most helpful to you in learning this?
- What are 3 interview questions one might be asked about this technology?

Also, please include the instructions necessary to...

- Run your example.
  - Do I need to run `bower install`? Do I need an API key?
- Use your subject.
  - Do I need to include it in my HTML with `<script>` tags? Do I need to `brew install` anything? Can I deploy it to Heroku?

## Suggestions for Subjects

You may chose from but are not limited to following...

- [Phaser JS](http://phaser.io/)

> **DO NOT** pick React since we will be learning about that next week.

## Deliverables

**NO LATER THAN 11:00AM:** Each team must submit a Git issue to the `sweet-libs` repository indicating...
- What technology you are learning
- Who is on the team

**NO LATER THAN 5:00PM:** The issue must be updated to include...
- A link to your main repository that contains a `readme.md` and code
- A comfort score (out of 5)
- **(Optional)** A reference to any particular sections of your code that you would like the instructors to review, and specific questions to guide instructor feedback
